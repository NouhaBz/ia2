# Animal Guessing Game

## Description
The **Animal Guessing Game** is a simple Java-based program that asks a series of yes/no questions to determine the type of animal the user is thinking of. The program follows a decision-tree approach to guess whether the animal is a mammal, bird, reptile, amphibian, or fish based on the user's responses.

## Features
- Interactive console-based game.
- Asks a series of logical questions to determine the type of animal.
- Uses user input (`yes` or `no`) to navigate through the decision tree.
- Covers a variety of animal classifications such as mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (Java 8 or later).

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
3. Compile the Java file using:
   ```sh
   javac AnimalGuessingGame.java
   ```
4. Run the program:
   ```sh
   java AnimalGuessingGame
   ```

## How to Play
1. The program will ask a series of yes/no questions.
2. Type `yes` or `no` (case-insensitive) to answer each question.
3. Based on your responses, the program will attempt to guess the animal.
4. If the program cannot determine the animal, it will let you know.

## Example Gameplay
```
Think of an animal, and I will try to guess it!
Does the animal have feathers? (yes/no)
yes
Does the animal fly? (yes/no)
yes
Is it a bird of prey? (yes/no)
yes
Is it an eagle? (yes/no)
yes
I guessed it!
```

## Future Improvements
- Add more animals for a broader range of guesses.
- Implement machine learning to improve guessing accuracy over time.
- Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user experience.
